# MaskDetection_Image
Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of detecting masks in real-time using images. The model should be able to accurately identify whether or not a face is wearing a mask in the image. To achieve this, we will be using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to create our model. We will use a dataset of images that contain both people wearing masks and people without masks in order to train our model. We will also use a technique called transfer learning to further improve the accuracy of our model. 

Step by Step Procedure:

1. Collecting the Data: The first step is to collect a dataset of images that contain both people wearing masks and people without masks. If available, one could use a pre-existing dataset of images with labeled masks and no masks. Otherwise, one would have to create a dataset on their own. 

2. Pre-processing the Data: The next step is to pre-process the data. This includes resizing and normalizing the images, as well as converting them to the proper format (i.e. RGB). 

3. Building the Model: After pre-processing the data, one can then begin to build the model. We will be using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for this task. The CNN should be able to accurately identify whether or not a face is wearing a mask in the image.

4. Training the Model: Once the model is built, it must be trained on the dataset. This is done by feeding the data into the model and allowing it to learn the patterns and features to accurately identify masks.

5.Evaluating the Model: After training the model, it should be evaluated on a separate test set of data. The goal is to measure the accuracy of the model in identifying masks in real-world images.
